# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—before your opponent does. It's a fun and simple game to play and practice coding logic. Must try with your friends.
